Background The vast majority of small molecule drugs act by binding a functionally important pocket on a target protein, thereby modulating the activity of that protein. For example, cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins bind the enzyme active site of HMG-CoA reductase, thus preventing the enzyme from engaging with its substrates. The fact that many such drug/target interacting pairs are known may have misled some into believing that a small molecule modulator could be discovered for most, if not all, proteins provided a reasonable amount of time, effort, and resources. This is far from the case. Current estimates are that only about 10% of all human proteins are targetable by small molecules. Bojadzic and Buchwald, Curr Top Med Chem 18: 674-699 (2019). The other 90% are currently considered refractory or intractable toward above-mentioned small molecule drug discovery. Such targets are commonly referred to as \u201cundruggable.\u201d These undruggable targets include a vast and largely untapped reservoir of medically important human proteins. Thus, there exists a great deal of interest in discovering new molecular modalities capable of modulating the function of such undruggable targets. It has been well established in literature that Ras proteins (K-Ras, H-Ras and N-Ras) play an essential role in various human cancers and are therefore appropriate targets for anticancer therapy. Indeed, mutations in Ras proteins account for approximately 30% of all human cancers in the United States, many of which are fatal. Dysregulation of Ras proteins by activating mutations, overexpression or upstream activation is common in human tumors, and activating mutations in Ras are frequently found in human cancer. For example, activating mutations at codon 12 in Ras proteins function by inhibiting both GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-dependent and intrinsic hydrolysis rates of GTP, significantly skewing the population of Ras mutant proteins to the \u201con\u201d (GTP-bound) state (Ras(ON)), leading to oncogenic MAPK signaling. Notably, Ras exhibits a picomolar affinity for GTP, enabling Ras to be activated even in the presence of low concentrations of this nucleotide. Mutations at codons 13 (e.g., G13D) and 61 (e.g., Q61K) of Ras are also responsible for oncogenic activity in some cancers. Despite extensive drug discovery efforts against Ras during the last several decades, a drug directly targeting the \u201con\" form of Ras is still not approved. Additional efforts are needed to uncover additional medicines for cancers driven by the various Ras mutations. \n Summary Provided herein are Ras inhibitors. These Ras inhibitors target, that is, selectively bind to or inhibit, Ras(ON) (e.g., selective over the GDP-bound, inactive state of Ras). The approach described herein entails formation of a high affinity three-component complex between a synthetic ligand and two intracellular proteins which do not interact under normal physiological conditions: the target protein of interest (e.g., Ras), and a widely expressed cytosolic chaperone (presenter protein) in the cell (e.g., cyclophilin A). More specifically, in some embodiments, the inhibitors of Ras described herein induce a new binding pocket in Ras by driving formation of a high affinity tri-complex between the Ras protein and the widely expressed cytosolic chaperone, cyclophilin A (CYPA). Without being bound by theory, the inventors believe that one way the inhibitory effect on Ras is effected by compounds of the invention and the complexes they form is by steric occlusion of the interaction site between Ras and downstream effector molecules, such as RAF and PI3K, which are required for propagating the oncogenic signal.

Definitions and Chemical Terms In this application, unless otherwise clear from context, (i) the term \u201ca\u201d means \u201cone or more\u201d; (ii) the term \"or\" is used to mean \"and/or\" unless explicitly indicated to refer to alternatives only or the alternative are mutually exclusive, although the disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and \"and/or\u201d; (iii) the terms \u201ccomprising\u201d and \u201cincluding\u201d are understood to encompass itemized components or steps whether presented by themselves or together with one or more additional components or steps; and (iv) where ranges are provided, endpoints are included. As used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used to indicate that a value includes the standard deviation of error for the device or method being employed to determine the value. In certain embodiments, the term \u201cabout\u201d refers to a range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less \nthan) of a stated value, unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (e.g., where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value). As used herein, the term \u201cadjacent\u201d in the context of describing adjacent atoms refers to bivalent atoms that are directly connected by a covalent bond. A \u201ccompound of the present invention\u201d and similar terms as used herein, whether explicitly noted or not, refers to Ras inhibitors described herein, including compounds of Formula Ia or Formula Ib and subformulae thereof, and compounds of Table 1a or Table 1b, as well as salts (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts), solvates, hydrates, stereoisomers (including atropisomers), and tautomers thereof. The term \u201cwild-type\u201d refers to an entity having a structure or activity as found in nature in a \u201cnormal\u201d (as contrasted with mutant, diseased, altered, etc.) state or context. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that wild-type genes and polypeptides often exist in multiple different forms (e.g., alleles). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain compounds described herein can exist in one or more different isomeric (e.g., stereoisomers, geometric isomers, atropisomers, tautomers) or isotopic (e.g., in which one or more atoms has been substituted with a different isotope of the atom, such as hydrogen substituted for deuterium) forms. Unless otherwise indicated or clear from context, a depicted structure can be understood to represent any such isomeric or isotopic form, individually or in combination. Compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more stereocenters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present disclosure that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically active starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present disclosure. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present disclosure are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. In some embodiments, one or more compounds depicted herein may exist in different tautomeric forms. As will be clear from context, unless explicitly excluded, references to such compounds encompass all such tautomeric forms. In some embodiments, tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond and the concomitant migration of a proton. In certain embodiments, a tautomeric form may be a prototropic tautomer, which is an isomeric protonation state having the same empirical formula and total charge as a reference form. Examples of moieties with prototropic tautomeric forms are ketone - enol pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, lactam - lactim pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, enamine - imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, such as, 1H- and 3H-imidazole, 1H-, 2H- and 4H-1,2,4-triazole, 1H- and 2H- isoindole, and 1H- and 2H-pyrazole. In some embodiments, tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution. In certain embodiments, tautomeric forms result from acetal interconversion. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. Exemplary isotopes that can be \nincorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 32P, 33P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I and 125I. Isotopically-labeled compounds (e.g., those labeled with 3H and 14C) can be useful in compound or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes can be useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). In some embodiments, one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by 2H or 3H, or one or more carbon atoms are replaced by 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon. Positron emitting isotopes such as 15O, 13N, 11C, and 18F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Preparations of isotopically labelled compounds are known to those of skill in the art. For example, isotopically labeled compounds can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed for compounds of the present invention described herein, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. As is known in the art, many chemical entities can adopt a variety of different solid forms such as, for example, amorphous forms or crystalline forms (e.g., polymorphs, hydrates, solvate). In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention may be utilized in any such form, including in any solid form. In some embodiments, compounds described or depicted herein may be provided or utilized in hydrate or solvate form. At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the present disclosure are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the present disclosure include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term \u201cC1-C6 alkyl\u201d is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl. Furthermore, where a compound includes a plurality of positions at which substituents are disclosed in groups or in ranges, unless otherwise indicated, the present disclosure is intended to cover individual compounds and groups of compounds (e.g., genera and subgenera) containing each and every individual subcombination of members at each position. The term \u201coptionally substituted X\u201d (e.g., \u201coptionally substituted alkyl\u201d) is intended to be equivalent to \u201cX, wherein X is optionally substituted\u201d (e.g., \u201calkyl, wherein said alkyl is optionally substituted\u201d). It is not intended to mean that the feature \u201cX\u201d (e.g., alkyl) per se is optional. As described herein, certain compounds of interest may contain one or more \u201coptionally substituted\u201d moieties. In general, the term \u201csubstituted\u201d, whether preceded by the term \u201coptionally\u201d or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable substituent, e.g., any of the substituents or groups described herein. Unless otherwise indicated, an \u201coptionally substituted\u201d group may have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. For example, in the term \u201coptionally substituted C1-C6 alkyl-C2-C9 heteroaryl,\u201d the alkyl portion, the heteroaryl portion, or both, may be optionally substituted. Combinations of substituents envisioned by the present disclosure are preferably those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term \u201cstable\u201d, as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for \ntheir production, detection, and, in certain embodiments, their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.

Single dose experiment; all doses well tolerated. Detailed Description Compounds Provided herein are Ras inhibitors. These Ras inhibitors target, that is, selectively bind to or inhibit, Ras(ON) (e.g., selective over the GDP-bound, inactive state of Ras). As used herein, the term \u201cRAS(ON) inhibitor\u201d refers to an inhibitor that targets, that is, selectively binds to or inhibits, the GTP- bound, active state of RAS (e.g., selective over the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS). Inhibition of the GTP-bound, active state of RAS includes, for example, the inhibition of oncogenic signaling from the GTP-bound, active state of RAS. In some embodiments, the RAS(ON) inhibitor is an inhibitor that selectively binds to and inhibits the GTP-bound, active state of RAS. In certain embodiments, RAS(ON) inhibitors may also bind to or inhibit the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS (e.g., with a lower affinity or inhibition constant than for the GTP-bound, active state of RAS). In some embodiments, a RAS(ON) inhibitor has a molecular weight of between 800 and 1100 Da, inclusive. Accordingly, for example, the term \u201cKRAS(ON) inhibitor\u201d refers to any inhibitor that binds to KRAS in its GTP-bound \u201cON\u201d position. A \u201cKRASG12C(ON) inhibitor\u201d is a KRAS inhibitor that selectively binds to or targets the G12C mutant form of KRAS. Non-limiting examples of RAS(ON) inhibitors, some of which are KRASG12C(ON) inhibitors, are provided in WO 2021091982, WO 2021091967, WO 2021091956, and WO 2020132597. As used herein, the term \u201cRAS(OFF) inhibitor\u201d refers to an inhibitor that targets, that is, selectively binds to or inhibits the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS (e.g., selective over the GTP-bound, active state of RAS). Inhibition of the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS includes, for example, sequestering the inactive state by inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby inhibiting RAS from adopting the active conformation. In certain embodiments, RAS(OFF) inhibitors may also bind to or inhibit the GTP-bound, active state of RAS (e.g., with a lower affinity or inhibition constant than for the GDP-bound, inactive state of RAS). In some embodiments, a RAS(OFF) inhibitor has a molecular weight of under 700 Da. In some embodiments, a RAS(OFF) inhibitor has a molecular weight of under 700 Da. Accordingly, for example, the term \u201cKRAS(OFF) inhibitor\u201d refers to any inhibitor that binds to KRAS in its GDP-bound \u201cOFF\u201d position. A \u201cKRASG12C(OFF) inhibitor\u201d is a KRAS inhibitor that selectively binds to or targets the G12C mutant form of KRAS. KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitors are known in the art and non-limiting examples include adagrasib and sotorasib. Additional KRAS(OFF) inhibitors are provided herein. The term \u201cinhibitor\u201d means a compound or agent (e.g., peptide, antibody) that prevents a biomolecule, (e.g., a protein) from completing or initiating a reaction. An inhibitor can inhibit a reaction by competitive, uncompetitive, or non-competitive means. The approach described herein entails formation of a high affinity three-component complex between a synthetic ligand and two intracellular proteins which do not interact under normal physiological \nconditions: the target protein of interest (e.g., Ras), and a widely expressed cytosolic chaperone (presenter protein) in the cell (e.g., cyclophilin A). More specifically, in some embodiments, the inhibitors of Ras described herein induce a new binding pocket in Ras by driving formation of a high affinity tri- complex between the Ras protein and the widely expressed cytosolic chaperone, cyclophilin A (CYPA). Without being bound by theory, the inventors believe that one way the inhibitory effect on Ras is effected by compounds of the invention and the complexes they form is by steric occlusion of the interaction site between Ras and downstream effector molecules, such as RAF, which are required for propagating the oncogenic signal. Without being bound by theory, the inventors postulate that non-covalent interactions of a compound of the present invention with Ras and the chaperone protein (e.g., cyclophilin A) may contribute to the inhibition of Ras activity. For example, van der Waals, hydrophobic, hydrophilic and hydrogen bond interactions, and combinations thereof, may contribute to the ability of the compounds of the present invention to form complexes and act as Ras inhibitors. Accordingly, a variety of Ras proteins may be inhibited by compounds of the present invention (e.g., a wild-type Ras or Rasamp, or K-Ras, N- Ras, H-Ras, and mutants thereof at positions 12, 13 and 61, such as G12C, G12D, G12V, G12S, G13C, G13D, and Q61L, and others described herein, as well as combinations of Ras proteins).

By way of example, compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described in the Schemes below, together with synthetic methods \nknown in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. These methods include but are not limited to those methods described in the Schemes below. Scheme 1. General synthesis of macrocyclic esters \n A general synthesis of macrocyclic esters is outlined in Scheme 1. An appropriately substituted indolyl boronic ester (1) can be prepared in four steps starting from protected 3-(5-bromo-2-iodo-1H-indol- 3-yl)-2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol and appropriately substituted boronic acid, including palladium mediated coupling, alkylation, de-protection, and palladium mediated borylation reactions. Methyl-amino-3-(4-bromothiazol-2-yl)propanoyl)hexahydropyridazine-3-carboxylate (3) can be prepared via coupling of (S)-2-amino-3-(4-bromothiazol-2-yl)propanoic acid (2) with methyl (S)- hexahydropyridazine-3-carboxylate. The final macrocyclic esters can be made by coupling of methyl-amino-3-(4-bromothiazol-2- yl)propanoyl)hexahydropyridazine-3-carboxylate (3) and an appropriately substituted indolyl boronic ester (1) in the presence of Pd catalyst followed by hydrolysis and macrolactonization steps to result in an appropriately protected macrocyclic intermediate (5). Deprotection and coupling with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid (or other coupling partner) can result in a macrocyclic product. Additional deprotection or functionalization steps could be required to produce a final compound 6. Further, with respect to Scheme 1, the thiazole may be replaced with an alternative optionally substituted 5 to 6-membered heteroarylene, or an optionally substituted 3 to 6-membered cycloalkylene, \n optionally substituted 3 to 6-membered heterocycloalkylene (e.g., morpholino), or optionally substituted 6- membered arylene (e.g., phenyl). Scheme 2. Alternative general synthesis of macrocyclic esters \n Alternatively, macrocyclic esters can be prepared as described in Scheme 2. An appropriately substituted and protected indolyl boronic ester (7) can be coupled in the presence of Pd catalyst with (S)- 2-amino-3-(4-bromothiazol-2-yl)propanoic acid, followed by iodination, deprotection, and ester hydrolysis. Subsequent coupling with methyl (S)-hexahydropyridazine-3-carboxylate, followed by hydrolysis and macrolactonization can result in iodo intermediate (11). Subsequent palladium mediated borylation and coupling in the presence of Pd catalyst with an appropriately substituted iodo aryl or iodo heteroaryl intermediate can yield an appropriately protected macrocyclic intermediate. Alkylation, deprotection and coupling with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid carboxylic acid (or other coupling partner) results in a macrocyclic product. Additional deprotection or functionalization steps could be required to produce a final compound 6. Further, with respect to Scheme 2, the thiazole may be replaced with an alternative optionally substituted 5 to 6-membered heteroarylene, or an optionally substituted 3 to 6-membered cycloalkylene, \noptionally substituted 3 to 6-membered heterocycloalkylene (e.g., morpholino), or optionally substituted 6- membered arylene (e.g., phenyl).

The term \u201ctreatment\u201d (also \u201ctreat\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d), in its broadest sense, refers to any administration of a substance (e.g., a compound of the present invention) that partially or completely alleviates, ameliorates, relieves, inhibits, delays onset of, reduces severity of, or reduces incidence of one or more symptoms, features, or causes of a particular disease, disorder, or condition. In some embodiments, such treatment may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of the relevant disease, disorder or condition or of a subject who exhibits only early signs of the disease, disorder, or condition. Alternatively, or additionally, in some embodiments, treatment may be administered to a subject who exhibits one or more established signs of the relevant disease, disorder or condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be of a subject who has been diagnosed as suffering from the relevant disease, disorder, or condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be of a subject known to have one or more susceptibility factors that are statistically correlated with increased risk of development of the relevant disease, disorder, or condition. \n The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount that is sufficient, when administered to a population suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, or condition in accordance with a therapeutic dosing regimen, to treat the disease, disorder, or condition. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is one that reduces the incidence or severity of, or delays onset of, one or more symptoms of the disease, disorder, or condition. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d does not in fact require successful treatment be achieved in a particular individual. Rather, a therapeutically effective amount may be that amount that provides a particular desired pharmacological response in a significant number of subjects when administered to patients in need of such treatment. It is specifically understood that particular subjects may, in fact, be \u201crefractory\u201d to a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount.\u201d In some embodiments, reference to a therapeutically effective amount may be a reference to an amount as measured in one or more specific tissues (e.g., a tissue affected by the disease, disorder or condition) or fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, serum, sweat, tears, urine). Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that, in some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount may be formulated or administered in a single dose. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount may be formulated or administered in a plurality of doses, for example, as part of a dosing regimen. For use as treatment of subjects, the compounds of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be formulated as pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions. Depending on the subject to be treated, the mode of administration, and the type of treatment desired, e.g., prevention, prophylaxis, or therapy, the compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are formulated in ways consonant with these parameters. A summary of such techniques may be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (2005); and Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Compositions can be prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and the present pharmaceutical compositions can contain from about 0.1% to about 99%, from about 5% to about 90%, or from about 1% to about 20% of a compound of the present invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, by weight or volume. In some embodiments, compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, described herein may be present in amounts totaling 1-95% by weight of the total weight of a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition. The composition may be provided in a dosage form that is suitable for intraarticular, oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular), rectal, cutaneous, subcutaneous, topical, transdermal, sublingual, nasal, vaginal, intravesicular, intraurethral, intrathecal, epidural, aural, or ocular administration, or by injection, inhalation, or direct contact with the nasal, genitourinary, reproductive or oral mucosa. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, e.g., tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granulates, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, gels including hydrogels, pastes, ointments, creams, plasters, drenches, osmotic delivery devices, suppositories, enemas, injectables, implants, sprays, preparations suitable for iontophoretic delivery, or aerosols. The compositions may be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice. As used herein, the term \u201cadministration\u201d refers to the administration of a composition (e.g., a compound, or a preparation that includes a compound as described herein) to a subject or system. \nAdministration to an animal subject (e.g., to a human) may be by any appropriate route. For example, in some embodiments, administration may be bronchial (including by bronchial instillation), buccal, enteral, interdermal, intra-arterial, intradermal, intragastric, intramedullary, intramuscular, intranasal, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intravenous, intraventricular, mucosal, nasal, oral, rectal, subcutaneous, sublingual, topical, tracheal (including by intratracheal instillation), transdermal, vaginal or vitreal. Formulations may be prepared in a manner suitable for systemic administration or topical or local administration. Systemic formulations include those designed for injection (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous injection) or may be prepared for transdermal, transmucosal, or oral administration. A formulation will generally include a diluent as well as, in some cases, adjuvants, buffers, preservatives and the like. Compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered also in liposomal compositions or as microemulsions. For injection, formulations can be prepared in conventional forms as liquid solutions or suspensions or as solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection or as emulsions. Suitable excipients include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol and the like. Such compositions may also contain amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, and so forth. Various sustained release systems for drugs have also been devised. See, for example, U.S. Patent No.5,624,677. Systemic administration may also include relatively noninvasive methods such as the use of suppositories, transdermal patches, transmucosal delivery and intranasal administration. Oral administration is also suitable for compounds of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Suitable forms include syrups, capsules, and tablets, as is understood in the art. Each compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as described herein, may be formulated in a variety of ways that are known in the art. For example, the first and second agents of the combination therapy may be formulated together or separately. Other modalities of combination therapy are described herein. The individually or separately formulated agents can be packaged together as a kit. Non-limiting examples include, but are not limited to, kits that contain, e.g., two pills, a pill and a powder, a suppository and a liquid in a vial, two topical creams, etc. The kit can include optional components that aid in the administration of the unit dose to subjects, such as vials for reconstituting powder forms, syringes for injection, customized IV delivery systems, inhalers, etc. Additionally, the unit dose kit can contain instructions for preparation and administration of the compositions. The kit may be manufactured as a single use unit dose for one subject, multiple uses for a particular subject (at a constant dose or in which the individual compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may vary in potency as therapy progresses); or the kit may contain multiple doses suitable for administration to multiple subjects (\u201cbulk packaging\u201d). The kit components may be assembled in cartons, blister packs, bottles, tubes, and the like. Formulations for oral use include tablets containing the active ingredient(s) in a mixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents or fillers (e.g., sucrose, sorbitol, sugar, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starches including potato starch, calcium carbonate, sodium chloride, lactose, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, or sodium phosphate)\ngranulating and disintegrating agents (e.g., cellulose derivatives including microcrystalline cellulose, starches including potato starch, croscarmellose sodium, alginates, or alginic acid); binding agents (e.g., sucrose, glucose, sorbitol, acacia, alginic acid, sodium alginate, gelatin, starch, pregelatinized starch, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, methylcellulose, optionally substituted hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or polyethylene glycol); and lubricating agents, glidants, and antiadhesives (e.g., magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, silicas, hydrogenated vegetable oils, or talc). Other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can be colorants, flavoring agents, plasticizers, humectants, buffering agents, and the like. Two or more compounds may be mixed together in a tablet, capsule, or other vehicle, or may be partitioned. In one example, the first compound is contained on the inside of the tablet, and the second compound is on the outside, such that a substantial portion of the second compound is released prior to the release of the first compound. Formulations for oral use may also be provided as chewable tablets, or as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent (e.g., potato starch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin), or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Powders, granulates, and pellets may be prepared using the ingredients mentioned above under tablets and capsules in a conventional manner using, e.g., a mixer, a fluid bed apparatus or a spray drying equipment. Dissolution or diffusion-controlled release can be achieved by appropriate coating of a tablet, capsule, pellet, or granulate formulation of compounds, or by incorporating the compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, into an appropriate matrix. A controlled release coating may include one or more of the coating substances mentioned above or, e.g., shellac, beeswax, glycowax, castor wax, carnauba wax, stearyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl distearate, glycerol palmitostearate, ethylcellulose, acrylic resins, dl-polylactic acid, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, vinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene, polymethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, 2-optionally substituted hydroxylmethacrylate, methacrylate hydrogels, 1,3 butylene glycol, ethylene glycol methacrylate, or polyethylene glycols. In a controlled release matrix formulation, the matrix material may also include, e.g., hydrated methylcellulose, carnauba wax and stearyl alcohol, carbopol 934, silicone, glyceryl tristearate, methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, or halogenated fluorocarbon. The liquid forms in which the compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Generally, when administered to a human, the oral dosage of any of the compounds of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, will depend on the nature of the compound, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art. A dosage may be, for example, about 0.001 mg to about 2000 mg per day, about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per day, about 5 mg to about 500 mg per day, \nabout 100 mg to about 1500 mg per day, about 500 mg to about 1500 mg per day, about 500 mg to about 2000 mg per day, or any range derivable therein. In some embodiments, the daily dose range for oral administration, for example, may lie within the range of from about 0.001 mg to about 2000 mg per kg body weight of a human, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may further comprise an additional compound having antiproliferative activity. Depending on the mode of administration, compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, will be formulated into suitable compositions to permit facile delivery. Each compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, of a combination therapy may be formulated in a variety of ways that are known in the art. For example, the first and second agents of the combination therapy may be formulated together or separately. Desirably, the first and second agents are formulated together for the simultaneous or near simultaneous administration of the agents. It will be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be formulated and employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with or administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder, or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). Administration of each drug in a combination therapy, as described herein, can, independently, be one to four times daily for one day to one year, and may even be for the life of the subject. Chronic, long-term administration may be indicated.

A compound of the present invention and an additional therapy, such as an anti-cancer agent, may be administered together, such as in a unitary pharmaceutical composition, or separately and, when administered separately, this may occur simultaneously or sequentially. Such sequential administration may be close or remote in time. In some embodiments, the additional therapy is the administration of side-effect limiting agents (e.g., agents intended to lessen the occurrence or severity of side effects of treatment. For example, in some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with a therapeutic agent that treats nausea. Examples of agents that can be used to treat nausea include: dronabinol, granisetron, metoclopramide, ondansetron, and prochlorperazine, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In some embodiments, the one or more additional therapies includes a non-drug treatment (e.g., surgery or radiation therapy). In some embodiments, the one or more additional therapies includes a therapeutic agent (e.g., a compound or biologic that is an anti-angiogenic agent, signal transduction inhibitor, antiproliferative agent, glycolysis inhibitor, or autophagy inhibitor). In some embodiments, the one or more additional therapies includes a non-drug treatment (e.g., surgery or radiation therapy) and a therapeutic agent (e.g., a compound or biologic that is an anti-angiogenic agent, signal transduction inhibitor, antiproliferative agent, glycolysis inhibitor, or autophagy inhibitor). In other embodiments, the one or more additional therapies includes two therapeutic agents. In still other embodiments, the one or more additional therapies includes three therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the one or more additional therapies includes four or more therapeutic agents. In this Combination Therapy section, all references are incorporated by reference for the agents described, , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, isomer (e.g., stereoisomer), prodrug, or tautomer thereof, whether explicitly stated as such or not. Non-drug therapies Examples of non-drug treatments include, but are not limited to, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, hyperthermia, surgery (e.g., surgical excision of tumor tissue), and T cell adoptive transfer (ACT) therapy. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be used as an adjuvant therapy after surgery. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be used as a neo-adjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Radiation therapy may be used for inhibiting abnormal cell growth or treating a hyperproliferative disorder, such as cancer, in a subject (e.g., mammal (e.g., human)). Techniques for administering radiation therapy are known in the art. Radiation therapy can be administered through one of several methods, or a combination of methods, including, without limitation, external-beam therapy, internal radiation therapy, implant radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery, systemic radiation therapy, radiotherapy and permanent or temporary interstitial brachy therapy. The term \"brachy therapy,\" as used herein, refers to radiation therapy delivered by a spatially confined radioactive material inserted into the body at or near a tumor or other proliferative tissue disease site. The term is intended, without limitation, to include \nexposure to radioactive isotopes (e.g., At-211, I-131, I-125, Y-90, Re-186, Re-188, Sm-153, Bi-212, P-32, and radioactive isotopes of Lu). Suitable radiation sources for use as a cell conditioner of the present invention include both solids and liquids. By way of non-limiting example, the radiation source can be a radionuclide, such as I-125, I-131, Yb-169, Ir-192 as a solid source, I-125 as a solid source, or other radionuclides that emit photons, beta particles, gamma radiation, or other therapeutic rays. The radioactive material can also be a fluid made from any solution of radionuclide(s), e.g., a solution of I-125 or I-131, or a radioactive fluid can be produced using a slurry of a suitable fluid containing small particles of solid radionuclides, such as Au-198, or Y-90. Moreover, the radionuclide(s) can be embodied in a gel or radioactive micro spheres. In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention can render abnormal cells more sensitive to treatment with radiation for purposes of killing or inhibiting the growth of such cells. Accordingly, this invention further relates to a method for sensitizing abnormal cells in a mammal to treatment with radiation which comprises administering to the mammal an amount of a compound of the present invention, which amount is effective to sensitize abnormal cells to treatment with radiation. The amount of the compound in this method can be determined according to the means for ascertaining effective amounts of such compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may be used as an adjuvant therapy after radiation therapy or as a neo-adjuvant therapy prior to radiation therapy. In some embodiments, the non-drug treatment is a T cell adoptive transfer (ACT) therapy. In some embodiments, the T cell is an activated T cell. The T cell may be modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CAR modified T (CAR-T) cells can be generated by any method known in the art. For example, the CAR-T cells can be generated by introducing a suitable expression vector encoding the CAR to a T cell. Prior to expansion and genetic modification of the T cells, a source of T cells is obtained from a subject. T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, cord blood, thymus tissue, tissue from a site of infection, ascites, pleural effusion, spleen tissue, and tumors. In certain embodiments of the present invention, any number of T cell lines available in the art may be used. In some embodiments, the T cell is an autologous T cell. Whether prior to or after genetic modification of the T cells to express a desirable protein (e.g., a CAR), the T cells can be activated and expanded generally using methods as described, for example, in U.S. Patents 6,352,694; 6,534,055; 6,905,680; 6,692,964; 5,858,358; 6,887,466; 6,905,681; 7,144,575; 7,067,318; 7,172,869; 7,232,566; 7,175,843; 7,572,631; 5,883,223; 6,905,874; 6,797,514; and 6,867,041.

BRAF inhibitors that may be used in combination with compounds of the invention include, for example, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib. A BRAF may comprise a Class 3 BRAF mutation. In some embodiments, the Class 3 BRAF mutation is selected from one or more of the following amino acid substitutions in human BRAF: D287H; P367R; V459L; G466V; G466E; G466A; S467L; G469E; N581S; N581I; D594N; D594G; D594A; D594H; F595L; G596D; G596R and A762E. MCL-1 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, AMG-176, MIK665, and S63845. The myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) protein is one of the key anti-apoptotic members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL- 2) protein family. Over-expression of MCL-1 has been closely related to tumor progression as well as to resistance, not only to traditional chemotherapies but also to targeted therapeutics including BCL-2 inhibitors such as ABT-263. In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is a SHP2 inhibitor. SHP2 is a non- receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the PTPN11 gene that contributes to multiple cellular functions including proliferation differentiation cell cycle maintenance and migration SHP2 has two N- \nterminal Src homology 2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2), a catalytic domain (PTP), and a C-terminal tail. The two SH2 domains control the subcellular localization and functional regulation of SHP2. The molecule exists in an inactive, self-inhibited conformation stabilized by a binding network involving residues from both the N-SH2 and PTP domains. Stimulation by, for example, cytokines or growth factors acting through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) leads to exposure of the catalytic site resulting in enzymatic activation of SHP2. SHP2 is involved in signaling through the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the JAK-STAT or the phosphoinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathways. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene and subsequently in SHP2 have been identified in several human developmental diseases, such as Noonan Syndrome and Leopard Syndrome, as well as human cancers, such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, neuroblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia and cancers of the breast, lung and colon. Some of these mutations destabilize the auto-inhibited conformation of SHP2 and promote autoactivation or enhanced growth factor driven activation of SHP2. SHP2, therefore, represents a highly attractive target for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of various diseases including cancer. A SHP2 inhibitor (e.g., RMC-4550 or SHP099) in combination with a RAS pathway inhibitor (e.g., a MEK inhibitor) have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro (e.g., pancreas, lung, ovarian and breast cancer). Thus, combination therapy involving a SHP2 inhibitor with a RAS pathway inhibitor could be a general strategy for preventing tumor resistance in a wide range of malignancies.

Table 4: Exemplary Compounds Prepared by Methods of the Present Invention \n\n\n\n\n\n In vitro and In vivo Experiments: Potency assay: pERK The purpose of this assay was to measure the ability of test compounds to inhibit K-Ras in cells. Activated K-Ras induces increased phosphorylation of ERK at Threonine 202 and Tyrosine 204 (pERK). This procedure measures a decrease in cellular pERK in response to test compounds. The procedure described below in NCI-H358 cells is applicable to K-Ras G12C. Note: this protocol may be executed substituting other cell lines to characterize inhibitors of other RAS variants, including, for example, AsPC-1 (K-Ras G12D), Capan-1 (K-Ras G12V), NCI-H1355 (K-Ras G13C), Hs 766T (K-Ras Q61H), NCI-H2347 or KU-19-19 (N-Ras Q61R), or SK-MEL-30 (N-Ras Q61K). NCI-H358 cells were grown and maintained using media and procedures recommended by the ATCC. On the day prior to compound addition, cells were plated in 384-well cell culture plates (40 \u00b5l/well) and grown overnight in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator. Test compounds were prepared in 10, 3-fold dilutions in DMSO, with a high concentration of 10 mM. On day of assay, 40 nl of test compound was added to each well of cell culture plate using an Echo550 liquid handler (LabCyte\u00ae). Concentrations of test compound were tested in duplicate. After compound addition, the plates are shaken for 15 seconds at 300 rpm, centrifuged, and cells were incubated 4 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Following incubation, culture medium was removed and cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline. \n In some experiments, cellular pERK level was determined using the AlphaLISA SureFire Ultra p- ERK1/2 Assay Kit (PerkinElmer). Cells were lysed in 25 \u00b5l lysis buffer, with shaking at 600 RPM at room temperature. Lysate (10 \u00b5l) was transferred to a 384-well Opti-plate (PerkinElmer) and 5 \u00b5l acceptor mix was added. After a 2-hour incubation in the dark, 5 \u00b5l donor mix was added, plate was sealed and incubated 2 hours at room temperature. Signal was read on an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer) using standard AlphaLISA settings. Analysis of raw data was carried out either a) in Excel (Microsoft) and Prism (GraphPad). Signal was plotted vs. the decadal logarithm of compound concentration, and IC50 was determined by fitting a 4-parameter sigmoidal concentration response model or b) using Genedata Screener (Genedata). Normalized signal was plotted vs the decadal logarithm of compounds concentration, and IC50 was determined by fitting a 4-parameter sigmoidal concentration response model. In other experiments, cellular pERK was determined by In-Cell Western. Following compound treatment, cells were washed twice with 200 \u00b5l tris buffered saline (TBS) and fixed for 15 minutes with 150 \u00b5l 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS. Fixed cells were washed 4 times for 5 minutes with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST) and then blocked with 100 \u00b5l Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) for 60 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibody (pERK, CST-4370, Cell Signaling Technology) was diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer, and 50 \u00b5l was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed 4 times for 5 minutes with TBST. Secondary antibody (IR-800CW rabbit, LI-COR, diluted 1:800) and DNA stain DRAQ5 (LI-COR, diluted 1:2000) were added and incubated 1-2 hours at room temperature. Cells were washed 4 times for 5 minutes with TBST. Plates were scanned on a Li-COR Odyssey CLx Imager. Analysis of raw data was carried out in Excel (Microsoft) and Prism (GraphPad). Signal was plotted vs. the decadal logarithm of compound concentration, and IC50 was determined by fitting a 4-parameter sigmoidal concentration response model. All compounds A001-A608 herein exhibit an IC50 of 2 \u00b5M or less in an AsPC-1 (K-Ras G12D) pERK potency assay and/or a Capan-1 (K-Ras G12V) pERK potency assay. About 40% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in a H358 K-Ras G12C context: of those that were measured, >99% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. About 40% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in a H1975 K-Ras WT context: of those that were measured, >96% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. Disruption of B-Raf Ras-binding Domain (BRAFRBD) Interaction with K-Ras by Compounds of the Invention Note \u2013 The following protocol describes a procedure for monitoring disruption of K-Ras G12C (GMP-PNP) binding to BRAFRBD by a compound of the invention. This protocol may also be executed substituting other Ras proteins or nucleotides. The purpose of this biochemical assay was to measure the ability of test compounds to facilitate ternary complex formation between a nucleotide-loaded K-Ras isoform and Cyclophilin A; the resulting ternary complex disrupts binding to a BRAFRBD construct, inhibiting K-Ras signaling through a RAF effector. Data was reported as IC50 values. In assay buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 0.002% Tween20, 0.1% BSA, 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2, tagless Cyclophilin A, His6-K-Ras-GMPPNP, and GST-BRAFRBD were combined in a 384-well assay plate at final concentrations of 25 \u00b5M, 12.5 nM and 50 nM, respectively. Compound was \npresent in plate wells as a 10-point 3-fold dilution series starting at a final concentration of 30 \u00b5M. After incubation at 25 oC for 3 hours, a mixture of Anti-His Eu-W1024 and anti-GST allophycocyanin was then added to assay sample wells at final concentrations of 10 nM and 50 nM, respectively, and the reaction incubated for an additional 1.5 hours. TR-FRET signal was read on a microplate reader (Ex 320 nm, Em 665/615 nm). Compounds that facilitate disruption of a K-Ras:RAF complex were identified as those eliciting a decrease in the TR-FRET ratio relative to DMSO control wells. Over 95% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in a K-Ras G12D context using the Ras-Raf assay: of those that were measured, >80% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under.

Over 95% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in a K-Ras G12C context: of those that were measured, >90% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. Over 95% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in a K-Ras G13C context: of those that were measured, >90% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. Determination of Cell Viability in RAS Mutant Cancer Cell Lines Protocol: CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Cell Viability Assay Note \u2013 The following protocol describes a procedure for monitoring cell viability of KRAS mutant cancer cell lines in response to a compound of the invention. Other RAS isoforms may be employed, though the number of cells to be seeded will vary based on cell line used. The purpose of this cellular assay was to determine the effects of test compounds on the proliferation of three human cancer cell lines (NCI-H358 (KRAS G12C), AsPC-1 (KRAS G12D), Capan-1 (KRAS G12V)) over a 5-day treatment period by quantifying the amount of ATP present at endpoint using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae 2.0 Reagent (Promega). Cells were seeded at 250 cells/well in 40 \u00b5l of growth medium in 384-well assay plates and incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. On the day of the assay, test compounds were prepared in 9, 3-fold dilutions in DMSO, with a high concentration of 1 or 10 mM as appropriate. The test compounds (40 nl) are directly dispensed to each well of cell culture plate using an Echo550 liquid handler (LabCyte\u00ae). The plates were shaken for 15 seconds at 300 rpm, centrifuged, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. On day 5, assay plates and their contents were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. CellTiter-Glo\u00ae 2.0 Reagent (25 \u00b5l) was added, and plate contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker before incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes. Luminescence was measured using the PerkinElmer Enspire. Data was normalized by the following: (Sample signal/Avg. DMSO)*100. The data was fit using a four- parameter logistic fit. Over 95% of compounds A001-A608 were measured using the CTG assay in an H358 (K-Ras G12C) cell line: of those that were measured, >90% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. Over 80% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in an AsPC-1 (K-Ras G12D) cell line: of those that were \nmeasured, >90% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. Over 80% of compounds A001-A608 were measured in a Capan-1 (K-Ras G12V) cell line: of those that were measured, >90% had an IC50 of 2 uM or under. Compound A, a Representative Inhibitor of the Present Invention, Drives Regressions of KRASG12D Tumors in Vivo Methods: Effects of Compound A on tumor cell growth in vivo were evaluated in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma HPAC KRASG12D/wt xenograft model using female BALB/c nude mice (6-8 weeks old). Mice were implanted with HPAC tumor cells in PBS (3 x 106 cells/mouse) subcutaneously in the flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~150 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. Compound A was administered by oral gavage once every other day (po q2d). Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Results: Single-agent Compound A administered at 50 mg/kg po and 100 mg/kg po every other day led to complete regression of all tumors in each group (complete regression defined as >85% tumor regression from baseline) at the end of treatment (Day 38 after treatment started) in the HPAC CDX model with heterozygous KRASG12D (FIG.1A). The anti-tumor activity of both tested doses of Compound A was statistically significant compared with control group (***p<0.001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Compound A, a Representative Inhibitor of the Present Invention, Regulates RAS Pathway and Drives Regressions of KRASG12V Tumors in Vivo Methods: Effects of Compound A on blood and tumor pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and tumor cell growth were evaluated in vivo in the human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NCI-H441 KRASG12V/wt xenograft model using female BALB/c nude mice (6-8 weeks old). Mice were implanted with NCI-H441 tumor cells (2 x 106 cells/mouse) in 50% media, 50% Matrigel, subcutaneously in the flank. For PK/PD, animals were grouped out when tumors were ~400 mm3 and animals were treated with a single dose of Compound A at 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg by oral gavage. For PK/PD n=3 measurements per timepoint. Once tumors reached an average size of ~155 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. In NCI-H441 Compound A was administered by oral gavage once daily (po qd) at 10 or 25 mg/kg. Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Results: Pharmacokinetics were analyzed based on total concentration (nM) of Compound A in tumors or blood, following a single oral gavage dose of Compound A at 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg, monitored through 72 hours following dose. Compound A exhibited dose-dependent exposure in blood and tumor samples. Compound A treated at 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg doses was detectable in tumors through 72 hours following treatment (FIG.1B). PK from na\u00efve animals treated with a single dose of Compound A delivered at 10 mg/kg demonstrates maximum exposure of at 2 hours (FIG.1C). Tumor DUSP6 demonstrates modulation of DUSP6, a marker of RAS pathway activity for 72 hours following single dose administration (FIG.1C). \n Single-agent Compound A administered to NCI-H441 tumor bearing animals, treated at 10 mg/kg po qd led to regressions (reductions in tumor volume >10% from initial) in all animals. Treated at 25 mg/kg po qd, Compound A led to complete regression of all tumors (complete regression defined as >85% tumor regression from baseline) at the end of treatment (Day 38 after treatment started) in the NCI- H441 CDX model with heterozygous KRASG12V (FIG.1D, FIG.1E). The anti-tumor activity of Compound A was statistically significant compared with control group (***p<0.0001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Treatments were well tolerated by body weight measurements (FIG.1F). Compound A, a Representative Inhibitor of the Present Invention, Drives Regressions of KRASG12V Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Colorectal Tumors in Vivo Methods: Effects of Compound A on tumor cell growth in vivo were evaluated in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-2 KRASG12V/wt and colorectal SW403 KRASG12V/wt xenograft models using female BALB/c nude mice (6-8 weeks old). Mice were implanted with Capan-2 tumor cells (4 x 106 (media/Matrigel) cells/mouse), or SW403 tumor cells (1 x 107 cells/mouse) in 50% PBS, 50% Matrigel, subcutaneously in the flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~160-170 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. In Capan-2, Compound A was administered by oral gavage once daily (po qd) at 10 or 25 mg/kg. In SW403 CDX, Compound A was administered by oral gavage once daily (po qd) at 25 mg/kg or every other day (q2d) at 50mg/kg. Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Results: Single-agent Compound A administered to Capan-2 tumor bearing animals, treated at 10 mg/kg po qd led to 5/8 regressions, and 25 mg.kg po qd led to 8/8 regressions at the end of treatment (Day 38 after treatment started) in the Capan-2 CDX model with heterozygous KRASG12V (FIG.2A, FIG. 2B). The anti-tumor activity of Compound A was statistically significant compared with control group (**p<0.01, ***p<0.0001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Treatments were well tolerated by body weight measurements (FIG.2C). In SW403 CDX model, single-agent Compound A administered at 25 mg/kg po daily or 50 mg/kg po q2d led to significant tumor growth inhibition in all tumors through the end of treatment (Day 35 after treatment started). Compound A treatment at 25 mg/kg po qd drove regressions in 8/8 tumors, and 2/8 CR\u2019s (FIG.2D, FIG.2E). Compound A treatment at 50 mg/kg po q2d drove regressions in 8/8 tumors. The anti-tumor activity of Compound A was statistically significant compared with control group (***p<0.0001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Treatments were well tolerated by body weight measurements (FIG.2F). Compound A Exhibits Potent in Vivo Inhibition of Multiple RAS-Driven Cancer Cell Lines Compounds A, B, and C Exhibit Potent in Vitro Inhibition of Multiple RAS-Driven Cancer Cell Lines Methods: Potency of in vitro cell proliferation inhibition of Capan-1 (KRASG12V), NCI-H358 (KRASG12C), AsPC-1 (KRASG12D), HCT116 (KRASG13D), SK-MEL-30 (NRASQ61K), NCI-H1975 (EGFRT790M/L858R), and/or A375 (BRAFV600E) cells exposed to Compounds A, B, or C for 120 hours. Cells were seeded in growth medium in 384-well assay plates and incubated overnight in a humidified \natmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. The following day, cells were exposed to a 9-concentration 3-fold serial dilution of Compound A, B, or C at a starting assay concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, or 10 \u03bcM as appropriate. After 5 days of incubation, CellTiter-Glo\u00ae 2.0 Reagent was added to assay plates and luminescence measured. Data were normalized to the mean signal of DMSO-treated cells, and IC50 values were estimated using a four-parameter concentration response model. Results: Compounds A, B, and C inhibited cell proliferation in RAS-driven lines (FIG.3A, FIG.3B, and FIG.3C). Compound A IC50s for RAS-Driven cancer cell lines are as follows: Capan-1 (KRASG12V) = 1 nM, NCI-H358 (KRASG12C) = 1 nM, AsPC-1 (KRASG12D) = 3 nM, HCT116 (KRASG13D) = 27 nM, SK- MEL-30 (NRASQ61K) = 13 nM, NCI-H1975 (EGFRT790M/L858R) = 1 nM. Compound B IC50s for RAS-Driven cancer cell lines are as follows: Capan-1 (KRASG12V) = 1 nM, NCI-H358 (KRASG12C) = 0.5 nM, AsPC-1 (KRASG12D) = 2 nM, HCT116 (KRASG13D) = 20 nM, SK-MEL-30 (NRASQ61K) = 5 nM, NCI-H1975 (EGFRT790M/L858R) = 1 nM. Compound C IC50s for RAS-Driven cancer cell lines are as follows: Capan-1 (KRASG12V) = 2 nM, NCI-H358 (KRASG12C) = 1 nM, AsPC-1 (KRASG12D) = 5 nM. RAS WT-Independent cell line A375 (BRAFV600E) was not sensitive to Compound A, B, or C treatment with IC50s >8700 nM, 4700 nM, and >10000 nM, respectively. Compound A, a Representative Inhibitor of the Present Invention, Drives Regressions of KRASG12D Tumors in Vivo Methods: Effects of Compound A on tumor cell growth in vivo were evaluated in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma HPAC KRASG12D/wt and colorectal GP2d KRASG12D/wt xenograft models using female BALB/c nude mice (6-8 weeks old). Mice were implanted with HPAC tumor cells (3 x 106 cells/mouse), or GP2d tumor cells (2 x 106 cells/mouse) in 50% PBS, 50% Matrigel, subcutaneously in the flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~150 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. Compound A was administered by oral gavage once daily (po qd) at 25 mg/kg. Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Results: Single-agent Compound A administered at 25 mg/kg po daily led to complete regression of all tumors (complete regression defined as >85% tumor regression from baseline) at the end of treatment (Day 38 after treatment started) in the HPAC CDX model with heterozygous KRASG12D (FIG. 4A, FIG.4B). The anti-tumor activity of Compound A was statistically significant compared with control group (***p<0.0001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Treatments were well tolerated by body weight measurements (FIG.4C). In Gp2d CDX model, single- agent Compound A administered at 25 mg/kg po daily led to significant tumor growth inhibition in all tumors through the end of treatment (Day 35 after treatment started) (FIG.4D, FIG.4E). The anti-tumor activity of Compound A was statistically significant compared with control group (***p<0.0001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Treatments were well tolerated by body weight measurements (FIG.4F). \nCompound A Down-Regulates Immune Checkpoint Proteins in NCI-H358, SW900, and Capan-2 Cells in Vitro Methods: To assess the effect of Compound A on checkpoint molecule expression in vitro, NCI- H358, SW900 or Capan-2 cells (5e4 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and after 24 hours treated with a five-fold dilution of Compound A in the presence of 250 pg/ml IFN ^. The plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 ^C and 5% CO2. The cells were detached with 0.25% Trypsin, incubated for 15 minutes in PBS containing Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen) and subsequently incubated with FITC anti- human CD274 (PD-L1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-human CD155 (PVR) and Brilliant Violet 605 anti-human CD73 (Biolegend) for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were washed twice with staining buffer (PBS/2% FCS) before flow cytometric acquisition on a Cytek Aurora instrument. The analysis was performed using the SpectroFlo and FlowJo v10 software. Results: Compound A produced a concentration-dependent 2- to 5-fold decrease of PD-L1, PVR and CD73 on NCI-H358 (FIG.5A), SW900 (FIG.5B), or Capan-2 (FIG.5C) cells in vitro. Down-regulation of these proteins is predicted to transform the immuno-suppressive tumor immune microenvironment in favor of anti-tumor immunity (Rothlin et al JITC 2020). Compound A, a KRAS(ON) inhibitor disclosed herein, is active against RAS oncogene switching mutations FIG.6A is a heatmap representing cellular RAS/RAF disruption assay results regarding various KRAS mutations in the presence of different RAS inhibitors (Compound A, a KRAS(ON) inhibitor disclosed herein, and KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitors MRTX849 (adagrasib) and AMG 510 (sotorasib)). Plasmids expressing nanoluciferase-tagged mutant KRAS4B and halo-tagged RAF1 (residues 51-149) were co-transfected into U2OS cells and incubated for 24 hours. Plasmids encoding the relevant mutation were generated by New England Biolabs Q5 site-directed mutagenesis. Transfected cells were reseeded at 25000 cells/well in 96-well plates in assay media (OptiMEM + 4% FBS + 100 nM HaloTag NanoBRET 618 Ligand) and incubated overnight. Promega Vivazine Nano-Glo substrate was added according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Compounds were added at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \u00b5M and incubated for 1 hour. The luminescence signal was measured at 460 nm and 618 nm and the BRET ratio was calculated as the 618 nm signal divided by the 460 nm signal. The BRET ratios were fit to a standard sigmoidal dose response function and the IC50 values were used to calculate the Log2(Fold- Change) relative to KRASG12C. FIG.6B shows the IC50 value associated with each colored bar of the heatmap. Compound A Drives Regressions of a Syngeneic KRAS G12C Tumor Model In Vivo and Synergizes with anti-PD-1 Methods: Effects of Compound A on tumor cell growth in vivo were evaluated in the murine syngeneic eCT26 KRASG12C/G12C ABCB1-/- I20 model using female Balb/c (6-8 weeks old). Mice were implanted with tumor cells (5 x 106 cells/mouse) in RPMI medium without supplements subcutaneously in the upper right flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~100 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. Compound A was administered by \noral gavage once daily (po qd) at 25 mg/kg. InVivoMAb anti-mouse PD-1 (CD279) antibody (Clone RMP1-14 from BioXCell) and InVivoMAb rat IgG2a isotype control (Clone 2A3 from BioXCell) were administered at 10 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection biweekly (ip biw). Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Results: Single-agent Compound A and the combination with anti-PD-1 led to complete regression of all tumors at day 14 after treatment start (FIGs.7C and 7D). The administration of Compound A was ceased at that time in the monotherapy and combination groups. Anti-PD-1 and isotype control were administered for 21 days. FIG.7A shows the isotype control results. In the anti-PD-1 monotherapy group, 2/10 tumors achieved complete regressions (FIG.7B). Tumor regrowth was observed in 4/10 mice treated with single agent Compound A and 0/10 mice treated with Compound A in combination with anti-PD-1(FIGs.7C and 7D). Treatments were well tolerated by body weight measurements (FIG.8). One animal in the group treated with Compound A monotherapy was found dead at day 14 after dosing stop. Compound A Modulates the Immune Tumor Microenvironment in Favor of Anti-tumor Immunity In Vivo Methods: eCT26 KRASG12C/G12C ABCB1-/- I20 tumors were removed 24 hours post the last dose after 4 days of treatment. Tumor tissue was minced, processed with the Miltenyi Biotec Mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit, and homogenized with the gentleMACS\u2122 Dissociator. The cell suspension was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes with Mouse BD Fc Block (Clone 2.4G2 from BD Pharmingen), 10 minutes with Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (from Invitrogen) and 30 min in cell staining buffer. Antibodies used targeted CD45 (Clone 30-F11 from BD Biosciences), CD19 (Clone 1D3 from BD Biosciences), CD3\u03b5 (145-2C11 from Biolegend), CD8b (Clone H35-17.2 from BD Biosciences), CD4 (Clone GK1.5 from Biolegend), F4/80 (Clone BM8 from Biolegend), Ly-6G (Clone 1A8 from BD Biosciences), Ly-6C (Clone HK1.4 from Biolegend), I-A/I-E (Clone M5/114.15.2 from BD Biosciences) and CD206 (Clone C068C2 from Biolegend). The eCT26 KRASG12C/G12C ABCB1-/- cell line was engineered from the murine CT26 homozygous KRASG12D tumor cell line (purchased from American Type Culture Collection). Both KRASG12D alleles were replaced with KRASG12C using CRISPR technology at Synthego. The following donor sequence GCCTGCTGAAAATGACTGAGTATAAACTTGTGATGGTTGGAGCTTGTGGCGTAGGCAAGAGCGCCTT GACGATACAGCTAATTCAGAATCA (SEQ ID NO: 1) and guide RNA sequence AUGGUUGGAGCUGAUGGCGU (SEQ ID NO: 2) were utilized. Additionally, the P-glycoprotein drug transporter was knocked out using the guide RNA sequences corresponding to TAAGTGGGAGCGCCACTCCA (SEQ ID NO: 3) and CCAAACACCAGCATCAAGAG (SEQ ID NO: 4), targeting the Abcb1a and Abcb1b genes. The homozygous G12C mutation and the ABCB1 knock out was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the clone I20. This clone was used for in vivo experiments. Results: Single-agent Compound A resulted in an increase of CD8+ T-cells (FIG.9A). Compound A also led to a decrease in M2 macrophages (FIG.9B) and monocytic MDSCs (FIG.9C). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. \nCompound A Exhibits Significant Anti-tumor Activity in KRASG12X Tumor Models In Vivo Methods: Effects of Compound A treatment on the growth of mutant KRAS-driven xenograft models of human NSCLC or PDAC in vivo was evaluated in a panel of representative CDX and PDX models in female immune-deficient mice. Mice were implanted with tumor cells or fragments subcutaneously in the flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~150-200 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. Compound A was orally administered at 25 mg/kg once daily. Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Responses were assessed as % change from baseline tumor volume after 21-42 days of treatment; study duration was based on controls reaching maximal tumor burden as an endpoint. Results: Single-agent Compound A administered at 25 mg/kg po daily led to tumor regressions in the majority of KRAS mutant models examined here (FIGs.10A and 10B). A small minority of models did not exhibit tumor regressions but showed significant tumor growth inhibition as compared to controls (not shown). Compound A Significantly Extends Time to Tumor Doubling Across Xenograft Models Methods: The impact of Compound A treatment on the growth of xenograft tumor models with RAS pathway aberrations (either mutations in K, H, or NRAS or upstream or downstream of RAS) in vivo was evaluated in a panel of representative CDX and PDX models in female immune-deficient mice. Mice were implanted with tumor cells or fragments subcutaneously in the flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~150-200 mm3, mice were randomized to treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. Compound A was orally administered at 25 mg/kg once daily. Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Responses were assessed via a survival analysis of time to progression with progression defined % change from baseline tumor volume within 28 days of treatment. Results: Single-agent Compound A administered at 25 mg/kg po daily led to a significant delay in time to tumor doubling in all the CDX and PDX xenograft models tested as compared to controls (p < 0.0001 assessed via a Log-Rank test) with the population not reaching a median time in the 28-day interval of this study (FIG.11). Interestingly, when time to tumor doubling was examined in the subset of models with a specific KRASG12X mutation, a further delay in time to tumor doubling models was observed in this subset, which was significantly differentiated from the overall model population (p < 0.005 via a Log-Rank test). These data indicate that tumors with KRASG12X mutation may be more susceptible to Compound A treatment as compared to tumors with other RAS pathway aberrations. Thus, these preclinical findings implicate KRASG12X mutation as an enrichment biomarker for patient enrollment in the context of RMC-Compound treatment in the clinical setting. Compounds A, B and D Drive Regressions of KRASG12V Tumors In Vivo Methods: The effects of compounds A, B and D on tumor cell growth in vivo were evaluated in the NCI-H441 KRASG12V/wt xenograft model of human non-small cell lung carcinoma using female BALB/c nude mice (6-8 weeks old). Mice were implanted with tumor cells in PBS (3 x 106 cells/mouse) subcutaneously in the flank. Once tumors reached an average size of ~200 mm3, mice were randomized \nto treatment groups to start the administration of test articles or vehicle. Compounds were administered orally once daily. Body weight and tumor volume (using calipers) was measured twice weekly until study endpoints. Results: Daily oral administration of each agent at 25 mg/kg led to the regression of all tumors in each treatment group at the end of treatment (Day 28 after treatment started) in this model (FIG.12A, FIG.12B, FIG.12C). The anti-tumor activity of each agent was statistically significant compared with control group (***p<0.001, ordinary One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons via a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test). Compounds A, B and D Deeply and Durably Inhibit RAS Pathway Signaling In Vivo Methods: The NCI-H441 KRASG12V/wt xenograft model of human non-small cell lung carcinoma was used for a single-dose PKPD study. Compounds A, B and D were administered orally at 25 mg/kg. The treatment groups with sample collections at various time points were summarized in Table 5 below. Tumor samples were collected to assess RAS/ERK signaling pathway modulation by measuring the mRNA level of human DUSP6 in qPCR assay. Table 5. Summary of treatment groups, doses, and time points for single-dose PD study using NCI-H441 tumors \n Results: All treatments led to inhibition of DUSP6 mRNA levels in tumors at all time points tested, indicating strong MAPK pathway modulation (FIG.13A). And the inhibitory effects of each compound on DUSP6 mRNA levels are durable even 48 hours after drug administration, consistent with the durable pharmacokinetic profile observed in the blood (FIG.13B).
